# WCU Programming Lessons

The purpose of this repo is to keep the lessons, assignments - that is, the codes - seen in the programming courses taught at Western Caspian University. There may be codes that may be useful to future students. 

## Structure

```Programming Language/TeacherName/``` - It is arranged this way because more than one different teacher can teach a language.




## Contributing

Unfortunately, I cannot share all the resources because I have not taken all software courses. You can support us to learn and share together. You can take a look at the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/qiyascc/wcu-programming-lessons/CONTRIBUTING.md) file to learn how 
to do it.
